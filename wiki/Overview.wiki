#summary A simple overview of the recent printing changes for openSUSE 10.3.

= Introduction =

The purpose of this project is to improve the desktop printing experience.  

= cups-autoconfig =

== Workflow ==
This is a smally utility that runs, via a HAL callout, whenever a local printer is added or removed.  It gathers information via HAL, CUPS, and the CUPS backends to determine the appropriate action.

Settings for this utility are controlled via /etc/sysconfig/printers.  It contains the following values:

CUPS_AUTOCONFIG_ENABLE - Controls local printers being auto-configured on addition.

CUPS_AUTOCONFIG_DISABLE - Controls local printers being disabled on removal.

CUPS_AUTOCONFIG_DEBUG - Controls debugging output /var/log/cups-autoconfig.log.

CUPS_AUTOCONFIG_PRINTER_POLICY: The name of the CUPS policy to assign to newly configured printers.

When a local printer is added to the system cups-autoconfig determines if the printer is already configured.  If the printer is configured then the printer is enabled.  If the printer is not configured then cups-autoconfig attempts to select the appropriate driver for the new printer and, if successful, creates a new print queue.  If the CUPS_AUTOCONFIG_PRINTER_POLICY variable is set it will assign the named policy to the new printer.

When a local printer is removed the CUPS_AUTOCONFIG_DISABLE variable is consulted.  If the variable is set to "yes" then the printer is disabled.

== DBUS Signals ==

Results of cups-autoconfig operations are reported via DBUS messages on the System bus.  If a new printer is successfully configured then a PrinterInfo message is sent via the org.cups.CupsAutoconfig interface.  If configuration fails (unable to find a matching driver, adding the queue fails, etc) then a PrinterConfigRequired message is sent using the same interface.  Policy applications running in the user's session should watch for these messages and take appropriate action.  See the gnome-volume-manager section for details.
